This telegram bot was created to automate job search.


He helps me find suitable jobs for me (Junior Java Developer).
His main job is to track new vacancies on such sites as Work.ua, Dou.ua, Robota.ua, Djinni.
At startup, the bot sends me all current vacancies. After that, it checks the above sites for new vacancies every hour, and throws them to me if they appear.

Stack of technologies I used:
Java Core,Spring Boot,Spring Data Jpa,PostgreSql,Telegram API,Maven
